# Ground Control Station Notification Design

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level design for notifying ground control stations when robot command sequences are completed. The solution uses an event-driven architecture combining Redis Pub/Sub for event distribution and HTTP webhooks for reliable delivery to external systems.

## Core Requirements

- **Real-time Notifications**: Ground control stations must be notified as soon as command sequences complete
- **Reliable Delivery**: Notifications must reach the intended recipients
- **Scalability**: Multiple ground control stations can register for notifications
- **RESTful Integration**: Standard HTTP-based webhook pattern for external system integration

                        └──────────────┘
```

## Event Flow

1. **Robot Command Execution**
   ```
   Robot receives command → Executes movement → Publishes event to Redis
   ```

2. **Event Distribution**
   ```
   Redis Pub/Sub → Webhook Dispatcher → HTTP POST to Ground Control Stations
   ```

3. **Notification Delivery**
   ```
   Webhook Dispatcher → Filter by event type → Send to registered URLs
   ```
